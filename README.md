# CNCF Service Desk

The CNCF offers a [strong backbone of services to open source projects](https://contribute.cncf.io/resources/project-services/) built around the goal of supporting most project needs outside of just code management and technical decisions.

We offer additional services via professional staff that cultivates the maturity and increased adoption of cloud native, open source projects. Details on the types of services that projects use are now provided on the [CNCF Contributors site](https://contribute.cncf.io/resources/project-services/).

The [CNCF Service Desk](http://servicedesk.cncf.io/) provides a way for maintainers to request these services. If you are a project maintainer, head to the [Service Desk](https://cncfservicedesk.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/user/login) and try to log in, if you can't find an account, email <info@cncf.io> and one will be created for you.
